### The free and open source personal music server

This project is an attempt to replace subsonic and its derivatives. Subsonic was
free upon its inception, but was changed to a closed source license. In
addition, some features were locked behind a pay wall. This project has none of
those intentions. Instead, it is intended to be a way to listen and share the
music that you own without having to upload it to someone else's server (unless
that is what you want)
